# Skid-Mobile
## Description
Mobile app that allows users to search for other employees within a company and immediately see information such as current titles, contact information, what department of the company they are working in, and most importantly, skills that they have.

The app's main focus is to try and combat the disconnect that people have within larger companies and solves this by encouraging cross communication and collaboration between people in different departments
